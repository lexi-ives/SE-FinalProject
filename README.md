### Description
Our project is a boss-rush browser game written in JavaScript where you fight randomly generated enemies and see how many you can defeat in a row before dying. Defeating an enemy grants the user experience, which increases the player's level and stats. Losing a fight sends you back to level one enemies, but your level is retained so you can progress further on your next try. 

Combat is turn-based, with a half second delay between turns. The player can choose one of four actions each turn: basic attack, strong attack, heal, and special attack. Each action has a cooldown, preventing you from using it until the cooldown period is over. The enemy will also take an action each turn. The first one to reduce the other's health bar to zero wins the fight.

The game is completely playable offline, but is hosted at http://www.tsny.io/SE-FinalProject/src/index.html
